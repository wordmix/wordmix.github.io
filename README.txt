 A quick "game" I made for my young daughter to let her play with the keyboard and maybe discover a word or two. Audio feedback helps since she can't read yet, but there's still plenty to see as words are kept in a list below the input. I would love feedback and ideas.

Notes:
- Uses WordsAPI for definitions and examples
- There are very few filters on the words. I try to remove sexual content, but I can't control the examples or definitions. Curse words are valid and allowed.
